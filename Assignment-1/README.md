##### Problem 1. Write a python program which takes string “Python” as a list of characters from console, delete at least 2 characters, reverse the resultant string and print it.

Output: Here, as shown in the screenshot, I am taking the input string from the user and after deleteing first 2 characters, I am printing the reversed string.
<br/>
##### Problem 2. Take two numbers from user and perform at least 4 arithmetic operations on them.

Output: I have taken 2 numbers from  the user input and performed arithmatic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Finally, printed all the outputs on the console.
<br/>
##### Problem 3. Write a program that accepts a sentence and replace each occurrence of ‘python’ with ‘pythons’ without using regex

Output: Here, user input string which has 'python' word in it is replaced by 'pythons' and finally the output is printed on the console window.
<br/>
##### Problem 4. Write a program, which reads weights (lbs.) of N students into a list and convert these weights to kilograms in a separate list using: 
##### 1) Loops

Output: I first created the empty lists and according to number of Students(N) from the user, I have appended list with weights in lbs. I applied another for loop to convert all the values in lbs to kgs and store it another list. Finally, I printed the contents of both the lists which shows weights in lbs and kgs.
##### 2) List comprehensions

Output: Few steps like getting the input and adding content in the first list is same as previous program. Here, I have appended the second list with List Comprehensions and converted the weights in kgs. Output is printed on the console window before and after conversion.
<br/>
##### Problem 5. Write a program that returns every other char of a given string starting with first using a function named “string_alternative”
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30693095/121732404-d8cbe880-cab7-11eb-9194-6bf4bee33ff7.png)
Output: I first defined a function which takes an input string as a parameter and prints a resultant string which has alternate characters of the original string. I called the defined function from the main program and user input was passed to it.
<br/>
##### Problem 6. Write a python program to find the wordcount in a file for each line and then print the output. Finally store (Append) the output back to the file.

Output: First we read the file and create a empty dictionary for storing word counts. Iterate over each line in the input file, to remove the leading spaces and newline character, and converting contents to lowercase. Next, split the lines into words and iterate over words.
If the word is already present in the dictionary then increase the count by 1 else add a record in the dictionary with new key and count 1 as value.
Finally, I printed the contents of the dictionary which has counts of all the words on the console.

Explaination: The output is also appended in the input file as well.
